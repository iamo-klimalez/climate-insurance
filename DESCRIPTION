Description: A web-app was developed for interested parties to design 
  index-based climate insurance and analyze their climate risk reduction 
  potential.  The app is fully automatic and does not require any knowledge 
  of statistics or programming languages. The web platform requires the 
  user to enter a period, crop yield and index information. Data can 
  be copy-pasted in any delineation (eg. space, comma). Consequently, 
  the web-app designs index-based climate insurance products based on 
  entered data and calculates descriptive statistics, and conducts 
  performance analysis.
