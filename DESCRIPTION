Description: "Climate Insurance" package was developed for interested 
  parties to design index-based climate insurance and analyze their 
  climate risk reduction  potential.  The package requires the user 
  to enter a period, crop yield and index information. Data can be 
  entered in any delineation (eg. space, comma). Consequently, 
  the package designs index-based climate insurance products based 
  on entered data and calculates descriptive statistics, and conducts 
  performance analysis.
